This repo contains all files needed to fulfill Holberton's project: HTML, avanced.
The purpose of this project is to recreate a HTML structure from a figma and its associated wireframe.
Doing so, I have learned HTML principles and basics.

Here is the list of learning objectives:
- What is HTML: HTML, for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language to structure web pages.
- How to create an HTML page from a wireframe: A wireframe is a visual representation of a web page. Each block is intended to be either a <header>, <main>, <footer>, <div> or <section>. Image boxes are <img> tags, text boxes are <p>, Titles are <h1> to <h6>, etc...
- What is a markup language: "A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs." (source: wikipedia)
- What is the DOM: Document Object Model (DOM) is a data representation of the structure and content of a document on the web as objects. It allows those structure and content to be manipulated (often with JavaScript).
- What is an element / tag: Elements and tags are the building blocks of a web page, a tag is a specific instruction enclosed in angle brackets (<div>), while an element includes the opening tag, its content, and its closing tag (if applicable) (<p>Some text</p>). The semantic of HTML defines the meaning and usage of these tags.
- What is an attribute: An attribute is an - often optional - additional instruction, it is annoted inside a tag and defines a more specific behavior (<p class="Example">Some text</p>).
- What the purpose of each HTML tag
